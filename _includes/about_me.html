				I have 10+ years of software engineering experience, at both startups and large orgs. 
				My expertise is in building scalable, distributed, fault tolerant backend systems. 
				I prefer prototypes to presentations, and can be often found obsessing about ways to optimize code, 
				sharing and soliciting ideas to make systems robust, whilst drinking copious amounts of coffee.

        <p>
           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilities, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
