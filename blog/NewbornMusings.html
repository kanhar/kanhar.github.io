                        <u><b>Labor</b></u> Not an ideal outcome to end up requiring a C-Section - but know that if you do, Anaesthesiologist's today recommend getting a <a href="https://www.nysora.com/topics/regional-anesthesia-for-specific-surgical-procedures/abdomen/combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia/">Combined Spinal Epidural (CSE)</a> 
                        over a regular epidural. A study from 2012 - <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076897/">Combined spinal-epidural versus epidural analgesia in labour</a> indicated no substantial basis for one 
                        being better than the other - despite a slightly faster onset for CSE's. We declined the CSE opting instead for the Regular Epidural Level L4-L5.

                        <u><b>Fever</b></u> Any parents worse nightmare - having their newborn develop a fever. To make matters worse, standard Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG's) for infants presenting with a fever / any kind of fever under 29 days of age requires getting 
                        a Lumbar Puncture (LP) to rule out a Serious Bacterial Infection(SBI). LPs for infants although necessary, often carry side effects and are obviously best avoided. 
                        Needless to say my recommendation is to monitor fever closely, and to minimize contact with the outside world for the first 29days. 

                        After 29days, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540147/">research indicates </a>that febrile infants in the range 29-56d require additional consideration before ruling out an SBI via LP as indicated 
                        However a separate analysis indicates that not all hospitals adhere to this, see 
                        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456211/">this</a> & 
                        <a href="https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/jhm015030181.pdf">this</a>. 
                        Given that predicting exact date of birth is difficult, the consequences of developing a fever even if due to a common cold - our recommendation would be to avoid visitors for the first 90days.

                        <u><b>Feeding</b></u> We were caught off guard with the variety of dynamic lactation challenges we experienced during the first two months. So much so that 
                        we recommend all expectant parents schedule a certified lactation consultant ( <a href="https://iblce.org/">IBCLC</a> provider ) to visit as soon as possible after birth.
                        Most insurances should cover these visits - although significant legwork may be required in filing the necessary claims. 
                        For the Seattle area we worked with and recommend highly <a href="https://www.sisterlycarelactation.com/">Judy Jewett</a> - who helped us through multiple at-home visits.

                        <u><b>Tongue Tie</b></u> An unfortunate event ~15% of parents have to deal with - but one best worth being prepared for. A 10x rise in tongue tie surgeries makes this
                        feel like a fad - and the evidence isn't overwhelmingly in favor of intervention. See <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30001811/">PMC 30001811</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33564576/">PMC 33564576</a>
                        Our primary pediatrician was reluctant to advocate for the frenectomy but secondary opinions from 2 naturopathic pediatrician concluded otherwise.
                        With one suggesting a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6299335/">Craniosacral massage</a> by a Registered Craniosacral Therapist (RCST) as a less invasive precursor, that works in 1 out of 4 cases.
                        Hoping to minimize intervention we scheduled two of these massages, but the RCST provider ultimately recommended we get an official Frenectomy evaluation. 
                        We scheduled this evaluation and the assessment confirmed a tongue tie case. With no compelling data either way, we consented to the surgery. 

                        <BR><BR>9 days later, we noticed the following improvements: daily feed durations went down from 200m to 130m. 
                            Daily feed session count went down from 9.5 to 8. 
                            Yet weight gain stayed linear and consistent. 
                            Given what we know we are glad we did this surgery.
